# Solar System
 An Open Frameworks project.  It is a moving solar system.

I created a solar system that had objects (planets) orbiting around a 
centre object (the Sun).  There are essentially two suns that are drawn that rotated on a centre pivot.  Each sun rotates in opposite directions to give a pleasing animation.  Two of the planets have their own orbiting object; one being Earth with the moon in orbit and Uranus which I have Neptune orbiting around. I also have a space ship that pivots on its centre pivot point; the nose end of the space ship follows the cursor when it is over the window.  The space ship will move towards the cursor when the mouse is left-clicked and will also move if the left-click is still pressed and the mouse is moved.  The space ship has a small head that is following it and is positioned in a way that makes it appear that the head is trying to eat the space ship.

I designed the sun and planets to look as appealing as possible on a black background, but I eventually added an old png image of a nebula that I created when I was in my first year of IMD.  I decided to be funny by having the head of a character named Kanna following the space ship trying to eat it.


I obtained the space ship from this link:https://pixabay.com/en/fighter-sci-fi-spaceship-tv-series-2024613/
